# Padding Oracle Attack

## Padding Oracle Attack

In cryptography, a padding oracle attack is an attack that uses padding validation of a cryptographic message to decrypt the ciphertext.

The first way of exploitation is through the registration panel, create a new user where intuiting that there is an admin user we define a new admin= user. In this way, creating the user what we will get is to create an instance of that user with the same properties, seeing all its content a posteriori as if it were the admin user. 

The second way of exploitation is to create a new user first. Once created, we carry out an authentication as the said user, catching the Session Cookie from the Network tab of the item inspection itself or from Burpsuite. 

Next, we use the padbuster tool to carry out the filler oracle attack. We follow the following syntax:

```bash
padbuster http://TARGET_IP:/login.php D8GjDDheDK%2F%2B7vMT7B7ceSyl3BuPZ10m 8 --cookies auth=D8GjDDheDK%2F%2B7vMT7B7ceSyl3BuPZ10m --encoding 0
```

With the session cookie and 8 declared as the number of blocks. Despite not knowing the exact figure, we can mount a simple loop `for i in $(seq 1 100)` in order to determine the number of blocks, because if it is not correct the injection can not be applied.
