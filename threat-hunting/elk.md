# ELK

## ELK

The abbreviation "ELK" stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, three open source projects. Elasticsearch is a data analytics and search engine. Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline that simultaneously ingests data from numerous sources, changes it, and transfers it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. In Elasticsearch, Kibana allows users to visualize data using charts and graphs.

The ELK stack can be found here:
