## Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap

Nmap scripts location:

```
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/
```

Nmap scripts database:

```
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db
```

Filter the vulnerability scripts and the exploit scripts defined in the categories:

```
cat /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db | grep '"vuln"\|"exploit"'
```

Run all scripts in the vuln category against a target:

```
sudo nmap --script vuln 10.10.10.11
```
