## IMAP Information

In computing, the **Internet Message Access Protocol** (**IMAP**) is an [Internet standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_standard) [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol\_\(computing\)) used by [email clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email\_client) to retrieve [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) messages from a [mail server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail\_server) over a [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_protocol\_suite) connection.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_Message\_Access\_Protocol#cite\_note-Network+\_Guide\_to\_Networks-1) IMAP is defined by [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC\_\(identifier\)) [3501](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501).

IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an [email box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email\_box) by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. An IMAP server typically listens on [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port\_number) 143. IMAP over [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport\_Layer\_Security) (**IMAPS**) is assigned the port number 993.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_Message\_Access\_Protocol#cite\_note-blum-email-sec-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_Message\_Access\_Protocol#cite\_note-practical-unix-sec-3)

Virtually all modern e-mail clients and [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server\_\(computing\)) support IMAP, which along with the earlier [POP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP3) (Post Office Protocol) are the two most prevalent standard protocols for email retrieval.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_Message\_Access\_Protocol#cite\_note-Red\_Hat-4) Many [webmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmail) service providers such as [Gmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail) and [Outlook.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook.com) also provide support for both IMAP and POP3.
