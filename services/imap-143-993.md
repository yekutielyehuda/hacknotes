## IMAP Information

In computing, the **Internet Message Access Protocol** \(**IMAP**\) is an [Internet standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_standard) [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_%28computing%29) used by [email clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client) to retrieve [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) messages from a [mail server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_server) over a [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) connection.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol#cite_note-Network+_Guide_to_Networks-1) IMAP is defined by [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_%28identifier%29) [3501](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501).

IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an [email box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_box) by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. An IMAP server typically listens on [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_number) 143. IMAP over [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) \(**IMAPS**\) is assigned the port number 993.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol#cite_note-blum-email-sec-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol#cite_note-practical-unix-sec-3)

Virtually all modern e-mail clients and [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29) support IMAP, which along with the earlier [POP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP3) \(Post Office Protocol\) are the two most prevalent standard protocols for email retrieval.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol#cite_note-Red_Hat-4) Many [webmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmail) service providers such as [Gmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail) and [Outlook.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook.com) also provide support for both IMAP and POP3.
