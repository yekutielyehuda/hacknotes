# Rsh - 514

## Rsh Information

For authentication, Rsh uses.rhosts files and /etc/hosts.equiv. For authentication, these methods used IP addresses and the DNS \(Domain Name System\). Spoofing IP addresses, on the other hand, is relatively simple, especially if the attacker is on the same network as the victim.

Default port: 514 Login
