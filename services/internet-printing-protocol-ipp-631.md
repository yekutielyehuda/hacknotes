# Internet Printing Protocol \(IPP\) - 631

## IPP Information

RFC2910 and RFC2911 define the Internet Printing Protocol \(IPP\). It is a protocol that can be extended; for example, â€˜IPP Everywhere' is a candidate for a standard in mobile and cloud printing, and IPP extensions for 3D printing have been released. IPP inherits all existing security features such as basic/digest authentication and SSL/TLS encryption because it is based on HTTP. An HTTP POST request is sent to the IPP server listening on port 631/tcp to submit a print job or retrieve printer status information.
