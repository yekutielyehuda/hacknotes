# Kerberos - 88

## Kerberos Information

Kerberos is a protocol for authentication, not authorization. In other words, it allows for the identification of each user who provides a secret password, but it does not validate which resources or services this user has access to. Active Directory makes use of Kerberos. Kerberos provides information about each user's privileges on this platform, but it is the responsibility of each service to determine whether the user has access to its resources.

Default Port: 88/tcp/udp
