# IRC - 194,6667,6660,7000

## IRC

**Internet Relay Chat (IRC)** is a text-based chat system. It enables discussions among any number of participants in so-called conversation channels, as well as discussions between only two partners.

### Banner

We may be able to gather the banner with nc:

```
nc -nv <IP> <PORT>
```

IRC does support TLS:

```
openssl s_client -connect <IP>:<PORT>
openssl s_client -connect <IP>:<PORT> -quiet
```

### Scan IRC Services

We can use nmap to scan IRC services:

```
nmap -sV --script irc-botnet-channels,irc-info,irc-unrealircd-backdoor -p 194,6660-7000 <IP>
```

### Bruteforce IRC

We can use nmap to bruteforce an IRC:

```
nmap -sV --script irc-brute,irc-sasl-brute --script-args userdb=/path/users.txt,passdb=/path/pass.txt -p <PORT> <IP>
```

### Chat Enumeration

**Question**: Why HexChat?

**Answer:** In the case that we do have IRC open on a large range of ports 6660-7000,7007 and connecting to these ports with command line options is proving to be unreliable due to frequent disconnections. Then HexChat may help you and it has a GUI.

We can install `hexchat` with `apt update && apt install -y hexchat`.

With HexChat open add a network and use the settings as per shown below. Ensuring the correct IP is set.

![IRC Servers -> Add](../.gitbook/assets/hexchat-connect-to-irc.png)

After doing it, you can close the window and then connect to the new network. You should see a similar screen as below:

![IRC HexChat  Connected](../.gitbook/assets/hexchat-irc.png)

From here go to `Server --> Channel List --> Perform a wildcard * search on the default settings` to find the channel **#x (replace the x with the channel-name)**.
