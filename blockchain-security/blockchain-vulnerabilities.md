# Blockchain Security

Every organization, team, or even a single identity building their/it's own blockchain application has to consider security in mind. In this page we'll go over the basics. 

## Types of Blockchains

There are few main types of blockchain:

- **Public blockchains**: anyone can join and validate transactions on  because they are open to the public.

- **Private blockchains**: are exclusive to business networks and are frequently restricted. Membership is controlled by a single entity, or consortium.

- **Permissionless blockchains**: processors are not restricted.

- **Permissioned blockchains**: Are only accessible to a small number of people who have been issued identities via certificates.

## Phishing

Phishing is a method of obtaining a user's credentials through deception. Emails seeming to be from a legitimate source are sent to wallet key owners by scam chevaliers. Users' credentials are requested via phony hyperlinks in the emails. Having access to a user's credentials and other sensitive data might result in both the user and the blockchain network losing money.

## Routing

Blockchains rely on huge data transfers in real time. Hackers have the ability to intercept data as it is sent to internet service providers. Because blockchain participants cannot see the threat in a routing attack, everything appears normal. Fraudsters, on the other hand, have extracted confidential data or currencies behind the scenes.

## Sybil

Hackers are able to generate and use multiple bogus network identities in a Sybil attack to flood the network and damage the system. Sybil is a fictional character who suffers from multiple personality/identity disorder.

## Stolen Keys

Anyone can steal or view a private key if it's not stored or protected safely.

## Backdoors & Exfiltrated Wallets

An adversary could try to gain access to your system  to your wallets through malware such as keyloggers, copy-from-clipboard, screenshots, screen viewing, notes, cracking password databases which may contain your account password,or even exfiltrating the wallets data.
