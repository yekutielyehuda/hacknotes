# Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency as its name implies it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means that encryption is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. However, there are other fundamental security concerns that we must keep in our minds.

Before going any further, you must understand these concepts:

Hot Wallet:
- Stored in online computers, applications, and others.
- Easy to access

Cold Wallet
- Stored in offline electronic devices.
- Harder to access

Public Keys:
- Your address, where you receive cryptocurrency
- Example: Your email address

Private Keys:
- The key to your wallet
- Example: Your email password

Key/Seed Generation:
- Generate each unique addresses for every transaction
- Example: Someone sends you crypto; to avoid being tracked we can generate a new address and use the new one and repeat.

Vulnerability Assesments:
- Make sure that the device where your wallet is stored is as secure as possible.
