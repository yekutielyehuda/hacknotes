# APT Emulation

In MITRE ATT\&CK, adversary emulation plans (AEPs) are a means to model adversary behavior based on a specific set of TTPs. MITRE, for example, has developed an AEP for APT3 to demonstrate how APT3 infects a system and exfiltrates sensitive data. To evaluate their defences, security teams utilize AEPs to develop attack simulations based on specific attackers.

AEPs can be used by your red team to create an attack simulation and test it against your business security system. These simulations use real-world attacks to help you uncover and fine-tune protection holes before an actual opponent hits. They also help to lighten the load on your security staff by providing them with more visibility into their environment.

## Caldera

CALDERA is a cyber security platform designed to easily automate adversary emulation, assist manual red-teams, and automate incident response. It is built on the MITRE ATT\&CK framework and is an active research project at MITRE
