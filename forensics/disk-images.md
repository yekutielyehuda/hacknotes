## Disk Image Recovery

As a forensic investigator, security analyst, threat hunter, or incident responder, you may want to recover deleted files. This is when Disk Image Recovery comes into place.

### dcfldd

dcfldd is a modified version of GNU dd. The major features added are hashing, fast disk wiping (through patterns) and status output.

dcfldd was originally created by Nicholas Harbour from the DoD Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL). Nick Harbour still maintains the package, although he is no longer affiliated with the DCFL.

### bulk\_extractor

bulk\_extractor is a program that extracts features such as email addresses, credit card numbers, URLs, and other types of information from digital evidence files. It is a useful forensic investigation tool for many tasks such as malware and intrusion investigations, identity investigations and cyber investigations, as well as analyzing imagery and pass-word cracking. The program provides several unusual capabilities including:

* It finds email addresses, URLs and credit card numbers that other tools miss because it can process compressed data (like ZIP, PDF and GZIP ﬁles) and incomplete or partially corrupted data. It can carve JPEGs, office documents and other kinds of files out of fragments of compressed data. It will detect and carve encrypted RAR files.
* It builds word lists based on all of the words found within the data, even those in compressed files that are in unallocated space. Those word lists can be useful for password cracking.
* It is multi-threaded; running bulk\_extractor on a computer with twice the number of cores typically makes it complete a run in half the time.
* It creates histograms showing the most common email addresses, URLs, domains, search terms and other kinds of information on the drive.

### Foremost

Foremost is a forensic program to recover lost files based on their headers, footers, and internal data structures. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery.
