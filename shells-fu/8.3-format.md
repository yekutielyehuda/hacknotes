# 8.3 Format

## 8.3 Format Naming Conventions

When accessing the Program Files directory from the command line of an early version of Windows, you may encounter an error such as "Invalid number of parameters." This error is often caused by the lack of support for long file names. To get around this error, use the [8.3 file format](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/num/8-3-format.htm) or surround the directory in quotes, as shown in the examples below.

```
cd \progra~1
```

or

```
cd "\program files"
```

In the first example command, **cd \progra\~1** goes back to the [root directory](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/root.htm) using "cd\\" and then from root goes into the 8.3 file format name of "program files." Once run, your [prompt](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/prompt.htm) should be changed to "C:\PROGRA\~1." The second example is similar to the first example, but it's surrounding "program files" in [quotes](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/q/quote.htm) to indicate to the computer its one directory name.

&#x20;In the Windows command line, you can see each file's short name using the [dir /x](https://www.computerhope.com/dirhlp.htm) command.

```
C:\Users\wixnic>dir /x
```
