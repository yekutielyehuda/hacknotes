# System on Chip (SoC)

System on Chips (SoCs) are vulnerable to hardware and software assaults due to the increasing complexity of on-chip components and the extended supply chain. These assaults can come from both inside the chip and via malicious software components. Because of the likelihood of hardware trojans being embedded within third-party Intellectual Properties (IPs), they are becoming untrustworthy. In internet of things (IoT) devices, cyber-physical systems, and embedded computing systems, security has become one of the most important aspects of system-on-chip (SoC) design.
