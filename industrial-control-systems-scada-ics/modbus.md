# Modbus

Modbus is a data communications protocol originally published by Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Modbus has become a de facto standard communication protocol and is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices.

Modbus is popular in industrial environments because it is openly published and royalty-free. It was developed for industrial applications, is relatively easy to deploy and maintain compared to other standards, and places few restrictions on the format of the data to be transmitted.

## Modbus Basics

Modbus describes the messaging communication dialog and is able to communicate over several physical media devices such as the following:

* RS-232 (OLDER and SHORTER DISTANCES)
* RS-485 (NEWER and LONGER DISTANCES)
* RS-422
* Ethernet

Modbus usually has the following networks models:

* Point-to-Point Network
* Multidrop Network

Es an example, Modbus enables devices on a network that measures temperature and humidity to communicate its results to a supervisory computer or PLC.

Modbus is supported by the ports:

* Ethernet
* Serial
* Modbus RTU
* Modbus ASCII
* Modbus TCP/IP
* Modbus Plus

Additonally, Modicon published the Modbus communication interface for a multidrop network based on the master/slave architecture.
