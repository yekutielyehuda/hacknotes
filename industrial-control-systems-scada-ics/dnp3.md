# DNP3

In the utility and power industries, the DNP3 is used in SCADA systems. SCADA monitoring systems that use Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) give workers with access into their DNP3 SCADA actions. 

The open DNP3 SCADA communications protocol allows DNP3 SCADA system gear to communicate with one another. These system components were unable to communicate before the development of DNP3. This prevented network operators from using SCADA equipment from a variety of suppliers in their operations. When a vendor dropped support for a product, there was no means to mediate the interactions, which was an issue.

Because DNP3 SCADA is an open-source protocol, any vendor can utilize it to create SCADA equipment. Staff can examine these messages through their masters using a DNP3 SCADA monitoring system.

## Remote Telemetry Units (RTUs)

Remote Telemetry Units (RTUs) capture DNP3 SCADA alarms from SCADA system components. The master station or HMI receives these alarms. For the network operator, they are mediated into a human-readable format. Staff can view their SCADA alerts in the DNP3 master software browser once this mediation is completed.

The DNP3 SCADA master will also convey these alarms to network technicians via pager and email alerts. These technicians can quickly restore SCADA operations by providing them with single locations of DNP3 SCADA system faults. The high-tech RTU features help to reduce income losses due to network outages.
