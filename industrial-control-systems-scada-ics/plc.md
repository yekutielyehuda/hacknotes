# PLC

A programmable logic controller (PLC) or programmable controller is an industrial computer that has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, machines, robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis. Dick Morley is considered as the father of PLC as he had invented the first PLC, the Modicon 084, for General Motors in 1968.

PLCs can range from small modular devices with tens of inputs and outputs (I/O), in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and SCADA systems.\[1]

## PLC Basics

The programmable logic controller (PLC) is a special purpose computer. It doesn't have a display, keyboard, printer, hard drive, and is usually placed in the control panel of a factory floor. The PLC has a CPU module and input/output (I/O) devices. The CPU communicates with the I/O, through this they share a backplane that physically holds them in place which are then electronically connected. These computers allow us to calculate Statistical Process Control (SPC) values and put PID controllers directly into a PLC program.

A PLC must be programmed. We can communicate with the PLC using Ethernet, USB or proprietary communication bus, depending on the manufacturer. Usually most PLCs are programmed using an application running on another computer such as laptop or a workstation.

## PLC Programming Languages

The  standard from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) defines several "programming languages" that we can use.
