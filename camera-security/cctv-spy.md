# CCTV Spy

CCTV cameras can be administered locally or remotely through the IP protocol. Therefore from a malicious perspective or from a security stand point they are still vulnerable to attacks.

## CCTV Applications

CCTV applications are generally used for the following purposes:

- Disaster management
- Monitoring
- Behavioral research
- Retail intelligence
- Crime management

However, from the attacker perspective these can be used to spy or for other malicious intentions.

These applications are runned on multiple operating systems such as:

- Mobile
	- iOS
	- Android
- Computer
	- Windows
	- Linux

Vulnerabilites in the application itself may exist or gaining access through credentials can be done as well.

Alternatively, some applications do offer P2P QR codes that can be scanned for cell phone clients and Device SN.

## Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilites may lie in any layer such as:

- Firmware
- Software
- Network

Even misconfigurations or not implementing the best practices can be an issue:

- Weak credentials
- Weak network configuration
- Others
