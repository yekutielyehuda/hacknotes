# IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to physical devices equipped with sensors, computing power, software, and other technologies that connect to and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communication networks. The term "internet of things" has been deemed a misnomer because gadgets do not need to be connected to the public internet; instead, they must be connected to a network and addressable individually. The convergence of many technologies, such as ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning, has shaped the sector. The Internet of Things is enabled by traditional domains such as embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, and automation (including home and building automation).

In the consumer market, IoT technology is most closely associated with products that support the concept of the "smart home," such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances that can be controlled by devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers.

However, a number of concerns have been raised about the risks associated with the growth of IoT technologies and products, particularly in the areas of privacy and security, and as a result, industry, and government efforts to address these concerns have begun, including the development of international and local standards, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks.

There are a-lot of more details to cover regarding IoT:
