# Pentesting with Go

## Go

 **Go** is a [statically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_typing), [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) designed at [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-techcrunch-11) by [Robert Griesemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer_%28computer_programmer%29), [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike), and [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson).[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-langfaq-12) Go is [syntactically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_%28programming_languages%29) similar to [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29), but with [memory safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety), [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29), [structural typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system),[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-structural_typing-6) and [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)-style [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-boldly-13) The language is often referred to as **Golang** because of its domain name, `golang.org`, but the proper name is Go.

### Credits

Most example code taken from [A Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/), which is an excellent introduction to Go. 

### Advantages vs Disadvantages

Advantages:

* Is compiled and it runs very fast.
* No run time required.
* It has concurrency out of the box.
* Is cross-platform.
* Is fantastic for networking.

Disadvantages:

* Is not very mature.

### Go in a Nutshell

* Compiles to native code \(no JVM\)
* No classes, but structs with methods
* Interfaces
* No implementation inheritance. There's [type embedding](http://golang.org/doc/effective%5Fgo.html#embedding), though.
* Functions are first class citizens
* Functions can return multiple values
* Has closures
* Pointers, but not pointer arithmetic
* Built-in concurrency primitives: Goroutines and Channels

### Visual Studio Code Configuration

Install the Support for Go in Visual Studio Code:

{% embed url="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go" %}

You can install it from the Visual Studio Code Extensions Marketplace:

Install the Go recommended extensions:

## Go Documentation

The most important thing, in my opinion, when learning a new language to read the official documentation:

## Go Code

If you want to learn how to write code in Go, I suggest that you read this:

## Go Basics

The very first line in any go file must be a package declaration and that begins with the naming convention:

```go
# Syntax:
package <name_here>

# Example:
package main
```

Every main package has to have a function named main.

The typical hello world code in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

You can run a go program with `run`:

```bash
‚ùØ go run main.go
hello
```

### Go Packages

* Package declaration must be at the top of every source file
* Executables are in package `main`
* Upper case identifier: exported \(visible from other packages\)
* Lower case identifier: private \(not visible from other packages\)

#### fmt

fmt stands for format and is in the go standard library.

### Go Variables

There are two ways in which we can define variables in Go.

The first one can be without the assignment operator:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var sayhello string
	sayhello = "hello world, again!"
	fmt.Println(sayhello)
}
```

The second way is to use the assignment operator `:=` this tells go to determine the value data type, in this case is a string:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sayhello := "hello world, again!"
	fmt.Println(sayhello)
}
```

### Go Parameters and Arguments

This is an example code containing some a parameter and an argument:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	helloworld("hello world!")
}

func helloworld(sayhello string) {
	fmt.Println(sayhello)
}
```

### Go Modules

We go.mod to create modules:

```bash
go mod init myapp
```
