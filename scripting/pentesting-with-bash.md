# Pentesting with Bash

## Special Variables

Common Special Variable names:

```text
$0 = the name of the bash script
$1 - $9 = the first nine arguments
$# = the number of arguments passed 
$@ = all arguments passed
$? = the exit status of the previous command
$$ = the process id of the current script
$USER = the name of the user running the script
$HOSTNAME = hostname
$RANDOM = a random number
$LINENO = the current line of the script
```

## Read User Input

read

```text
read $variable
```

Nice flags:

* -p = specify a prompt
* -s = silent user input \(hide text, is like when you are typing a password from the terminal, you can't see it\)

## Help 

A simple help menu can be made like this:

```bash
if [ "$#" == "1" ]; then
    file=$1
else
    echo "$0 [file]"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Ping Sweeps 

Ping sweeps one-liners:

```bash
for i in {1..255}; do (ping -c 1 172.18.0.$i > /dev/null && echo "172.18.0.$i is up" &); done
for i in `seq 1 255`; do (ping -c 1 172.18.0.$i > /dev/null && echo "172.18.0.$i is up" &); done
```

## Port Scans

Port scans one-liners:

```bash
for i in {1..65535}; do (echo > /dev/tcp/172.18.0.2/$i > /dev/null && echo "the port $i is open" &); done 2>/dev/null
for i in `seq 1 65535`; do (echo > /dev/tcp/172.18.0.2/$i > /dev/null && echo "the port $i is open" &); done 2>/dev/null
```

## Generate Wordlists

Generate a sequence list:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 1000); do echo $i >> ids.txt; done
```
