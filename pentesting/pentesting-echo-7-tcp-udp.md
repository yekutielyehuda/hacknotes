# Echo - 7/TCP/UDP

## Echo Information <a id="basic-information"></a>

The echo service was intended for testing and measurement purposes and may listen on both TCP and UDP protocols. The server sends back any data it receives, with no modification. **It's possible to cause a denial of service by connecting an echo service to the echo service on the same or another machine**. Because of the excessively high number of packets produced, the affected machines may be effectively taken out of service.â€‹

**Default Port:** 7/tcp/udp
