# Brute Force List

## Before Brute Force Rules

### Default Credentials

Always try default credentials first. Often, you will find that default configurations use the same password as the username:

```
admin:admin
username:username
```

Search on the internet to find the default credentials of a service or application:

```
default credentials of <service_name_here>
<service_name_here> default credentials
```
