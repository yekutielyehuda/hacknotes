# Protectors

## Protectors

A protector in this context is software that is intended to prevent tampering and reverse engineering of programs. The methods used can, and usually will, include both packing and encrypting. That combination plus some added features makes what is usually referred to as a protector.&#x20;

A completely different approach, which also falls under the umbrella of protectors, is code virtualization, which uses a customized and different virtual instruction set every time you use it to protect your application. Of these protectors there are professional versions that are used in the gaming industry against piracy but the technique itself has also made its way into malware.\
