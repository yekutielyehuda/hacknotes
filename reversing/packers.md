# Packers

## Packers

This usually is short for “runtime packers” which are also known as “self-extracting archives”. Software that unpacks itself in memory when the “packed file” is executed. Sometimes this technique is also called “executable compression”. This type of compression was invented to make files smaller this way users wouldn’t have to unpack them manually before they could be executed. When you see some packers being used nowadays, it is almost always for malicious purposes. In essence to make reverse engineering more difficult, with the added benefit of a smaller footprint on the infected machine.
