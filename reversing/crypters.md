# Crypters

## Crypter

The crudest technique for crypters is usually called obfuscation. Obfuscation is also used often in scripts, but most of the time these are not very hard to de-obfuscate. More complex methods use actual encryption. Most crypters do not only encrypt the file, but the crypter software offers the user many other options to make the hidden executable as hard to detect by security vendors as possible.
