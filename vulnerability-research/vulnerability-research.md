# Vulnerability Research

## Vulnerability Research

Security Researchers perform vulnerability research to discover vulnerabilities in software, protocols, hardware, among other digital technologies. The vulnerabilities discovered are then published or reported to third-parties. Then these reported vulnerabilities are later added to vulnerability databases for vulnerability assessments which are often performed by security analysts.

The goal of a vulnerability research is to find bugs that can be exploited.

### CVSS

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a free and open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities. CVSS attempts to assign severity scores to vulnerabilities, allowing responders to prioritize responses and resources according to threat.

#### CVSS Calculator

NVD has a nice calculator:

### VPR

**Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR)**

The VPR framework is a much more modern framework in vulnerability management - developed by Tenable, an industry solutions provider for vulnerability management. This framework is considered to be risk-driven; meaning that vulnerabilities are given a score with a focus on the risk a vulnerability poses to the organization itself.

VPR scoring takes into account the relevancy of a vulnerability. It is considerably dynamic in its scoring, where the risk that a vulnerability may pose can change almost daily as it ages.

### Vulnerability Databases

Vulnerabilities are classified under “**C**ommon **V**ulnerabilities and **E**xposures” (CVE).

These CVEs have the formatting of `CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER`.
