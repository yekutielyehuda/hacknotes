# Webmin

Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix. Using any modern web browser, you can setup user accounts, Apache, DNS, file sharing and much more. Webmin removes the need to manually edit Unix configuration files like /etc/passwd, and lets you manage a system from the console or remotely. See the standard modules page for a list of all the functions built into Webmin.

The information above was extracted from the [webmin website](https://www.webmin.com/).

The Webmin dashboard can be used for our advantage.

## Command Shell

Clicking Others -> Command Shell might load an overlay with a shell from which we can execute commands in the system:

```sh
ls
```

## Change Password

Sometimes under System -> Change Password, we can select the root account, and then change the password to whatever we want.

## Cron

We can configure cron jobs under System -> Schedule Cron Jobs.
