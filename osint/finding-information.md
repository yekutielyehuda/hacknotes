# Finding Information

## Finding Information

Before reading this page I recommend that you take a look at the search for information page, which I have written some advice there:

Let's say that maybe you are not sure what you can do with a service, function, web, just something that you haven't heard of... maybe you have to do some research on it. We'll refer to this as `<topic>` the thing that we need to find information on.

You will be reading posts, documentation, tutorials, and so on.

> Note:  &lt;command&gt; is referred to as commands, functions or methods.

Here are some examples of what we can search for:

```text
 # Get information about the topic:
<topic>
<topic> documentation
<topic> doc
# Search for what you can do with the service, function, whatever it is:
<topic> run command on remote node
<topic> remote command execution
<topic> execute shell command
<topic> execute os command
<topic> execute command
<topic> upload file
<topic> exploit
<topic> attack
<topic> pentesting
pentesting <topic>
<topic> github
github <topic>
<topic> <command> 
<topic> <command> stackoverflow
```

Then, if you have found something useful or odd, try adapting it to the target service.
