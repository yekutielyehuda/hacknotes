As you can see above, changing search engines can help you find more links.

### Use Specific Keywords

Keywords are the terms that you use to find content on the internet. Making your keywords as specific as possible will help your search engine to track down the information that you want.

### Simplify Your Searches

Stop words are included in the searches of some engines. Prepositions \(in, of, on\), conjunctions \(and, but\), and articles \(a, the\) are commonly used words, so you'll wind up with more pages in your search results than you need.

## Summary

* **Vary your search engine:** in fact, get in the habit of utilizing many, as each has its own set of advantages. 
* **Use particular keywords:** be as exact as possible when phrasing your sentences. 
* **Reduce the number of words** in your search phrases by removing unneeded stop words and avoiding suffixes.
* **Use quotation marks:** this narrows searches down to particular words and phrases.
* **Remove unhelpful words:** with the - \(minus\) operator, you can delete terms from your searches that are unclear or misleading.
* **Refine your search using operators:** use operators to search specific sites, related sites, and particular combinations of terms.
* **Avoid search pitfalls:** the internet is a selling tool as well as a fantastic resource. Be sure that you only view advertisements **if** you want to.
