# Adaptive and Evasive

AI can be used for malicious intentions. In the case of malware, we can use AI to detect the current environment, adapt, and evade anti-virus/anti-malware scanners. Furthermore, it can be used to automate attacks against enterprise networks and other targets in general. 

## Agent

An example of an agent could have the following methodology or steps:

```text
Anti-malware -> malware sample -> action -> agent -> generates payload -> send payload -> ta-da!.
```

The key here is that we could create an agent for adapting and evading the specific anti-malware.
