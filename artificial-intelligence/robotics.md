# Robotics

I won't be suprised if we will be able to administer robots remotely. This one will be interesting to cover in the future for sure. 

Robotics can or could have a few of these vulnerabilities:

- Insecure Features
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Backdoors
- Device Theft
- Fake Applications
- Unencrypted Backups (Unlikely)
- Unencrypted Communications (Unlikely)
- DoS/DDoS
- Keyloggers
- Password Cracking
- Logic Tampering

They could be targeted by the following:

- Malicious Users
- Malicious Manufacturers
- External Adversary
- Others

There are multiple layers that we can take into consideration:

- Hardware
- Firmware
- Software
