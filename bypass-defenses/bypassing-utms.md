# Bypassing UTMs

Unified Thread Management (UTM)s are becoming more popular lately. When various security features or services are merged into a single device within your network, this is referred to as a hybrid device. Users on your network are secured by a variety of functions, including antivirus, content filtering, email and web filtering, anti-spam, and more, when you utilize UTM.

UTM allows a company to combine all of its IT security services into a single device, potentially simplifying network security. As a result, your company can keep track of all threats and security-related activity through a single window. You have complete, streamlined insight into all parts of your security or wireless infrastructure in this manner.

However, like any other security device or electronic device it always has it's vulnerabilites.

## FortiGate Example

An example could be web filtering; simply googling something such as the following:

```text
bypass fortigate web filters
```

You may get results that may work.

Again the same applies to anti-virus/anti-malware, firewall, ids/ips, and others.
