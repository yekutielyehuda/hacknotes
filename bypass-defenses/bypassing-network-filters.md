# Bypassing Network Filters

Network filters prevents clients from searching certain keywords. However, these can be bypassed as well. It is very common to see system administrators or network administrators monitoring the enterprise network to make sure that employees are not searching on their workstations for unethical things. 

As an employee you should always respect and follow the company policies and rules. If you really need to access a resource then I think that you might be able to request ticket to the help desk, network administrators, system administrators, or the IT team/department.

## VPN

We can use a VPN to create a secure tunnel through an ISP link to a VPN service provider that would have unrestricted internet connection. Therefore it wouldn't have network filters. This would be very suspicious.

## DNS Servers

We can use different DNS servers because a network filter usually listens on one DNS server. However, this is very suspicious.

## Proxy Servers

Is funny how many times I heard from system administrators that some employees do use proxies to avoid their workplace network filters. However, as an employee you should never do this; respect your company policy but it is possible that you can easily bypass a workplace content filter via a web-based proxy without having to change the device settings.

## URL Shorteners

An easy solution is to simply use URL shorteners but this would be really suspicious to see.
