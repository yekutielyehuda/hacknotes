# Searching for Exploits

## Pre-requisites for running exploits

* Check the version of the operating system.
* Check the software version.
  * Check if there is an exploit for it (Searchsploit, ExploitDB, Google, Github, etc).
* Check if the exploit doesn't harm your system and/or network.

## Methodology

Here's the search order methodology that I often use when I'm searching for public exploits. I first enumerate/find applications, services, banners, http headers requests and responses, and rarely games... from there I do the following (I have included how I find them, read the comments):

```shell
# Application Name found from Web Applications or OS Applications:

<application_name>
<application_name> exploit
<application_name> <version> 
<application_name> <version> exploit

# Names of Services found from nmap -sV, Web Applications, SMB enum, NFS enum, FTP enum, or others

<service_name>
<service_name> exploit
<service_name> <version> 
<service_name> <version> exploit

# Banners found from nmap -sV, nc -v, netcat -v or others

<banner_name>
<banner_name> exploit
<banner_name> <version>
<banner_name> <version> exploit

# Request and Response Headers found from:
# - All ports that are hosting web services
# - Including every web page
# - Every input 
# using curl -v, curl -I, whatweb, devtools -> network, burpsuite, nikto, and others

<http_header_name>
<http_header_name> exploit
<http_header_name> <version> 
<http_header_name> <version> exploit
<http_header_name> <value>
<http_header_name> <value> exploit
<http_header_name> <value> <version> 
<http_header_name> <value> <version> exploit

# Games found from game servers, IRCs, OS Locally Installed Games, or others:

<game_name> 
<game_name> exploit
<game_name> <version>
<game_name> <version> exploit
```

Then try more specific searches like including the `name of the machine or hostname`, `operating system`, or the attack vector like `sqli, xss, lfi, rfi, directory traversal, privilege escalation, rce, remote command execution` and so on.

> Note: Some applications may have more than one vulnerability. For example, you may find an SQL Injection exploit, this one will allow you to login to the application, but then there's an (Authenticated) Remote Command Execution exploit so that you can get a foothold on the system.

You can also use Google Operators or DuckDuckGo Operators:

```
<service_name> site:exploit-db.com
<service_name_version> site:exploit-db.com
```

## Browser

Always search in "google" or others:&#x20;

```
<service_name> [version] exploit
<service_name> [version]
<service_name> cve
<service_name> [version] cve
<service_name> [version] github 
<service_name> [version] github exploit
<service_name> [version] github cve
<service_name> <year>
<service_name> <year> exploit
<service_name> <year> exploit github
```

You should also try the **shodan** **exploit search** from [https://exploits.shodan.io/](https://exploits.shodan.io).

## Searchsploit

Useful to search exploits for services in **exploitdb from the console.**

**Update exploitdb package:**

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb
```

**Location:**

```
/usr/share/exploitdb
```

**Use searchsploit:**

```
searchsploit
searchsploit --update
searchsploit keywords name version
searchsploit program os
searchsploit program os local
```

**If searchsploit doesn't return anything, then change the pattern of the search**

```
searchsploit program version_number
searchsploit program
```

**Inspect and Mirror:**

```
searchsploit -x name
searchsploit -m name
```

### Searchsploit with Date

```
searchsploit --json osticket | jq
```

### Searchsploit tricks <a href="#searchsploit-tricks" id="searchsploit-tricks"></a>

```
searchsploit "linux Kernel" #Example
searchsploit apache mod_ssl #Other example
searchsploit -m 7618 #Paste the exploit in current directory
searchsploit -p 7618[.c] #Show complete path
searchsploit -x 7618[.c] #Open vi to inspect the exploit
searchsploit --nmap file.xml #Search vulns inside an nmap xml result
```

## MSF-Search

```
msf> search platform:windows port:135 target:XP type:exploit
```

## PacketStorm

If nothing is found, try to search the used technology inside [https://packetstormsecurity.com/](https://packetstormsecurity.com)

## Vulners

You can also search in vulners database: [https://vulners.com/](https://vulners.com)

## Sploitus

This search exploits in other databases: [https://sploitus.com/](https://sploitus.com)

## Security Focus

Information about exploits: [https://www.securityfocus.com/ï»¿](https://www.securityfocus.com)

## The Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF):

Run BeEF with:

```
sudo beef-xss
```

Navigate to your localhost:

* [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000)

The default credentials are:

* beef:beef

Navigate to the following path:

* 127.0.0.1 > Commands > Exploits

## Google Operators for Exploits

```
site:
inurl:
intext:
intitle:
site:exploitdb <name of exploit>
site:github <name of exploit>
service_version exploit
"CVE-2017-8917" exploit site:github.com
pfsense cve
```

### Google Search Methods for Exploits <a href="#google-search-methods-for-exploits" id="google-search-methods-for-exploits"></a>

```
