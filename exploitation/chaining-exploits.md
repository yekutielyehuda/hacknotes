# Chaining Exploits

## Chaining Exploits

We may require or be able to combine multiple vulnerabilities into a chain of exploits that culminates with a position on the targeted system.

## Example of a Chained Exploitation

In order to chain an exploit a few things are required:

1. Two vulnerabilities or more
2. A common point in which we can take advantage of the other vulnerability found.

Example Scenario:

Let's say that we have two domains or two web applications within the same host. One application is phpLiteAdmin which has a remote command execution vulnerability and the other one has an LFI vulnerability but for the **phpLiteAdmin** exploit, we need the path of some files in order to trigger the remote code execution vulnerability, however, we cannot access those files within phpLiteAdmin. This is when the LFI vulnerability comes into place. If we create a malicious command on phpLiteAdmin and access the file via LFI in order to execute the file that has the malicious command then with this we could have done a chain of exploits in order to establish a connection on the target system (e.g a reverse shell remote command execution, executed via LFI).

## Summary

There are 2 vulnerabilities on the host but you need to use both of them together in order to exploit the system.
